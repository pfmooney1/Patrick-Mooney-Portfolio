             <h1>Latin Verb Chart Generator</h1>
             <h2>The Idea</h2>
                 <p class="paragraphContent">
                    The most time-consuming part of teaching Latin is filling out verb charts. What if I could automate it?<br>
                    Teachers have a Catch-22 when it comes to verb charts. With almost 300 different forms complicated by four different rule-sets, it takes too long to write on the whiteboard during class, but the alternative is to spend the limited free time typing up answer keys. What if I could write a program that could do it for me? 
                 </p>
             <h2>The Approach</h2>
                 <p class="paragraphContent">
                     The user types the dictionary entry of any Latin verb (for example, <i>do, dare, dedi, datum</i>) in the input field and regular expressions takes it apart, forms the appropriate stems, and IDs the conjugations. After that, itâ€™s a giant program of manipulating and editing strings then placing them in the appropriate boxes. 
                </p>
             <h2>The Challenge</h2>
                <p class="paragraphContent">
                    The most unexpected challenge I encountered was dealing with all the different ways that teachers and students could input the same verb. Some textbooks teach using commas, as in <i>do, dare, dedi, datum</i>, others use hyphens, others still use only spaces. I have even seen semi-colons from time to time. 
                 </p>
             <h2>The Solution</h2>
                <p class="paragraphContent">
                    The solution was regular expressions, and this was the project that made me break out flashcards and just master them. Without regular expressions I would have had to code for every possible way that a user could input the same verb. With regular expressions, all I needed to add was <code>/\w+/g</code>, and no matter how the user input the code, it would still work.
                </p>
             <h2>My Favorite Part</h2>
                <p class="paragraphContent">
                    My favorite part of the code takes the input, assigns to a variable, then breaks that string into the necessary four principle parts. Seven lines of JavaScript code and a regular expression eliminate the need for four separate input elements in the HTML and accommodates users accustomed to different ways of writing Latin.
                    <br>Short, elegant, and user-friendly.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Here's the code: <br>
                </p>
                <div class="sampleCode">
                    <pre>
                    <code>
// takes the input, assigns it to a variable, and converts it to lower case.
var chosenVerb = document.getElementById(id).value;
chosenVerb = chosenVerb.toLowerCase();
//
// Takes verb and takes apart the principle parts of the verb
var verbParts = chosenVerb.match(/\w+/g);
var firstPP = verbParts[0];
var secondPP = verbParts[1];
var thirdPP = verbParts[2];
var fourthPP = verbParts[3];
                    </code>
                    </pre>
                    </div>
