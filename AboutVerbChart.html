             <h1>Latin Verb Chart Generator</h1>
             <h2>The Idea</h2>
                 <p class="paragraphContent">
                    The most time-consuming part of teaching Latin is filling out verb charts. What if I could automate it?<br>
                    Teachers have a Catch-22 when it comes to verb charts. With almost 300 different forms complicated by four different rule-sets, it takes too long to write on the whiteboard during class, but the alternative is to spend the limited free time typing up answer keys. What if I could write a program that could do it for me? 
                 </p>
             <h2>The Approach</h2>
                 <p class="paragraphContent">
                    The user types the dictionary entry of any Latin verb (for example, do, dare, dedi, datum) in the input field and regular expressions takes it apart, forms the appropriate stems, and IDs the conjugations. After that, itâ€™s a giant program of manipulating and editing strings then placing them in the appropriate boxes. 
                </p>
             <h2>The Challenge</h2>
                <p class="paragraphContent">
                    The most unexpected challenge I encountered was dealing with all the different ways that teachers and students could input the same verb. Some textbooks teach using commas, as in <i>do, dare, dedi, datum</i>, others use hyphens, others still use only spaces. I have even see semi-colons. 
                 </p>
             <h2>The Solution</h2>
                <p class="paragraphContent">
                    The solution was regular expressions, and this was the project that made me break out flashcards and just master them. Without out regular expressions I would have had to code for every possible way that a user could input the same verb. With regular expressions, all I needed to add was <code>/\w+/g</code>, and no matter how the user input the code, it would still work.
                </p>
             <h2>My Favorite Part</h2>
                <p class="paragraphContent">
                    My favorite part of the code takes the input, assigns to a variable, then breaks that string into the necessary four principle parts. Seven lines of JavaScript code and a regular expression eliminate the need for four separate text elements in the HTML and accommodates users accustomed to different ways of writing Latin.
                    <br>Short, elegant, and user-friendly.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Here's the code: <br>
                </p>
                <div class="sampleCode">
                    <pre>
                    <code>
// takes the input, assigns it to a variable, and converts it to lower case.
var chosenVerb = document.getElementById(id).value;
chosenVerb = chosenVerb.toLowerCase();
//
// Takes verb and takes apart the principle parts of the verb
var verbParts = chosenVerb.match(/\w+/g);
var firstPP = verbParts[0];
var secondPP = verbParts[1];
var thirdPP = verbParts[2];
var fourthPP = verbParts[3];
                    </code>
                    </pre>
                    </div>
