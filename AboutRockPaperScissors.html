             <h1>Rock Paper Scissors</h1>
             <h2>The Idea</h2>
                 <p class="paragraphContent">
This was my very first attempt at making a game in HTML/CSS/JavaScript. <br>
The idea itself was simple. Can I quickly throw together a rock paper scissors game using just HTML, CSS, and my limited knowledge of JavaScript at the time?

                 </p>
             <h2>The Approach</h2>
                 <p class="paragraphContent">
                    For the "Computer Player", I simply coded a function that would pick a random number between 1 and 3: 1 was rock, 2 was paper, 3 was scissors. When the player picked either rock, paper, or scissors, it would also call the computer pick function, decide who won or if it was a tie, then update the score. A separate button reset the scoreboard.
                </p>
             <h2>The Challenge</h2>
                <p class="paragraphContent">
                    The biggest challenge that appeared after my first pass at coding the game was that it required the player to press a separate button to try another round. This was clunky and inconvenient with the user needing to move the mouse across the whole screen and back just to try again. If the user did not press the button, however, it would not reset the Rock Paper Scissor choices and the user would only be left with the option of making the previous choice again.
                 </p>
             <h2>The Solution</h2>
                <p class="paragraphContent">
                    My solution was to create a nested if statement inside the function called by the user on Rock-Paper-Scissors choice. If the round was reset, the click would play the round. If the round was not reset, it would reset the round. This eliminated the need for a round-reset button and made the game much more enjoyable to play in the process.
                </p>
             <h2>My Favorite Part</h2>
                <p class="paragraphContent">
                    My favorite part of the code is the function that makes the "Computer Player"'s choice occur. A random number is selected and with that either Rock, Paper, or Scissors. Then the choice is shown to the player by hiding the other options and the AI's avatar.
                    Short and simple.

                    Here's the code: <br>
                </p>
                <div class="sampleCode">
                    <pre>
                    <code>
    // Opponent Choice
    function opponentChooses() {
        opponentImage.style.display = "none";
        var number = Math.random();
        number = (number * 3) + 1;
        number = Math.floor(number);
        switch (number) {
             case 1: 
                  opponentChoice = "rock";
                  rockOpponent.style.display = "table-cell";
                  paperOpponent.style.display = "none";
                  scissorsOpponent.style.display = "none";
                  break;
            case 2: 
                  opponentChoice = "paper";
                  rockOpponent.style.display = "none";
                  paperOpponent.style.display = "table-cell";
                  scissorsOpponent.style.display = "none";
                  break;
            case 3:
                  opponentChoice = "scissors";
                  rockOpponent.style.display = "none";
                  paperOpponent.style.display = "none";
                  scissorsOpponent.style.display = "table-cell";
                  break;
