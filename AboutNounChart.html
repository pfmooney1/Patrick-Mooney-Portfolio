             <h1>Monopoly Bank Accounts</h1>
             <h2>The Idea</h2>
                 <p class="paragraphContent">
                     What if you could play Monopoly without touching the bills? <br>
                     The slowest part of playing Monopoly is handling the money and crunching numbers. While it's fantastic when someone lands on your monopoly with four houses on it, 90% of the time it is counting and passing back and forth less than $95.<br> What if there was a faster way? What if there were monopoly bank accounts?
                 </p>
             <h2>The Approach</h2>
                 <p class="paragraphContent">
                     I made a table tall enough to fit up to 10 players and made it wide enough to fit enough actions to play the board game without touching the paper bills. I had just learned how to create and use Modals and I applied them to the project as well, creating the Start and Repair screens. I also used SVG icons instead of PNG or JPGs to take advantage of their speed and scalability. I wanted to make it customizable when playing so I added the ability to change the font, color theme, and the player names.
                 </p>
             <h2>The Challenge</h2>
                <p class="paragraphContent">
                    This project presented two challenges. <br>
                    First, as I coded the modals it got increasingly hard to stop bugs from popping up, especially in the repairs modals. I would edit a modal and not find the changes taking place, only to realize that I was coding in the wrong modal. <br>
                    Second, the dropdown select element that I had coded for the alternate themes/fonts looked ugly and was unappealing to use. 
                 </p>
             <h2>The Solution</h2>
                <p class="paragraphContent">
                    I solved the modals challenge with clear commenting above each modal in the HTML file. This made it easy to know for sure which modal I was editing and how it functioned in relation to the rest of the modals. An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. 
                    <br>
                    Second, I replaced my dropdown/select elements with toggle tokens coded in vanilla HTML/CSS/JS. I liked these because it made it clear which one was selected, it gave the user a preview of what they were choosing, and they looked significantly better.
                </p>
             <h2>My Favorite Part</h2>
                <p class="paragraphContent">
                    The piece of code I am most proud of is the JavaScript  function the takes the number of houses and hotels a player has and charges them accordingly based on whether they landed on Chance or Community Chest. Stopping a game of monopoly to crunch those numbers was always annoying, and I love how a problem like that can be solved in so few lines of code. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Here's the code: <br>

                          if (a === 'communityChest') {

                            communityChestHouses = Number(communityChestHouses);
